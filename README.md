# Mirth Connect testing made easy with Spock

This library provides a suite of tools to make testing Mirth Connect channels much simpler.

# Purpose
TODO add

# To test a new Mirth Connect library

1. Create a Gradle project
2. Add your JavaScript functions from Mirth Connect into `/src/main/js`
3. Start writing your specification tests using Spock in `/src/test/groovy`
4. TODO complete this bit, including MVN/Gradle reqs

# Testing Mirth Results components

Yeah, that's possible too. Unlike Mirth Connect, the Mirth Results domain classes aren't in the public domain, but once you've obtained a copy for MirthCorp you can just include the library in your Gradle project and it'll just work.
